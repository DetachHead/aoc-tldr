# 2022, day 2
## example input
```
A Y
B X
C Z
```
## part 1
- these are rock paper scissors rounds
- left column is your opponent's choices: `A`=rock, `B`=paper, `C`=scissors
- right column is your choices: `X`=rock, `Y`=paper, `Z`=scissors
- the "score" for each round is calculated like:
  **shape you selected** (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus **outcome of the round** (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won)
- calculate the total score (add the scores for each round together)

## part 2
- the second column is now the result of the round (`X`=you lose, `Y`=draw, `Z`=you win)
- calculate what your choice should be to match the outcome of the round
- now you can calculate the scores the same way as part 1
